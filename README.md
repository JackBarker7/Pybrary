# Pybrary
A Python program to manage a library of PDFs.

Script can be run dicrectly, through `pybrary.py`. I recommend that it is run from `pybrary.bat` (on Windows). The batch file will automatically activate a virtualenv and then run the script.

Recommended directory structure:

* master directory  
  * pybrary.bat  
  * books  
    * books go here  
  * Pybrary  
    * pybrary.py  
    * env  
    * resources  
    * etc.
