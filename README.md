# Pybrary #
A Python program to manage a library of PDFs.

Script can be run dicrectly, through `pybrary.py`. I recommend that it is run from `pybrary.bat` (on Windows). The batch file will automatically activate a virtualenv and then run the script.

The library data is stored in `library.json`. An example is included in the repo.

I have also included a virtual environment with necessary packages installed.

The GUI is written using [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and the add, delete and open icons used were downloaded from https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

## Recommended directory structure: ##

* master directory  
  * pybrary.bat  
  * books  
    * books go here  
  * Pybrary  
    * pybrary.py  
    * env  
    * resources  
    * etc.
